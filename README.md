Behave video scoring
Use maven to build this project.
You will need InnoSetup, JSmooth and VLC player (32-bit) installed in order to build the binary.
Prior to building, modify pom.xml and setup.iss so they point to your local paths.
You can also try the binary provided here, but I can't promise anything...
